# Reminders

##Google maps
In order for google maps to work, a key is needed to be provided in src/debug/res/values/strings.xml or in the metadata in the manifest file

## Assumptions made:
* User cannot edit or remove a reminder
* User won't have 100 location reminders at a time (the geofencing api limit) 


## Tests
Sample tests can be found under src/test and src/androidTest
